# LuaMalwareToolkit
Educational Purpose only! This is a toolkit to assemble viruses for penetration testing on various platforms (ComputerCraft / OpenComputers / Lua 5.3)

# Notes
This was created as my previous toolkit got to messy and needs a complete rewrite and reorganisation.

# Requirements
* Optional  LuaSockets from LuaRocks 3.0-rc1
* Optional  LuaFileSystem 1.6.3

# IRC
If you need help with the toolkit or just general lua hacking help, i made an irc room at ```esper.net``` ```#lmt```
Please note that this chatroom is also for educational purpose only!
